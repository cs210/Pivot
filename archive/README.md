This folder contains old features that we are no longer focused on, but we want to save in case we need to reference them in the future. 

### GPS to Relative Positions

Using the GPS data of images to determine their relative positions. Determined that GPS data is not accurate enough to determine relative positions for a 3D walkthrough.

See more in `gps_to_rel_pos` and [issue #50](https://github.com/cs210/Phoenix-Recon/issues/50).

### 3D Reconstruction
* This is a "Priority 3" feature. 
* It will add value to users who want to experience what it feels like to walk through the space but don't need the highest-possible level of detail. These users could include recovery/response teams preparing to enter dangerous zones. 
* Creating these reconstructions and viewing them in a VR headset has posed significant technical challenges, including just to run existing models.
