### Quick and dirty demo of how to do photo stitching in command line using Python's `opencv-python

not gonna try and configure this to work with our frontend and backend yet, since idk what majd is doing

basically when you run stitch.py you get prompted to input the path to a directory (containing the images to be stitched)
and then the output gets saved as a separate image file.

happens pretty quick: took abt 10 seconds to stitch 16 12MP images into a 34MP panorama on my macbook
